                    task running, and version control
                    snippets, embedded Git control and GitHub,
                    syntax highlighting, and code refactoring.
                    It aims to provide just the tools a
                    developer needs for a quick code-build-debug
                    cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller
                    featured IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE.
